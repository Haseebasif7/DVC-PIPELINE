# **ML Pipeline with Data Version Control**

This repository implements a  Machine Learning (ML) pipeline using Data Version Control (DVC) for efficient tracking and management of large datasets and models. The pipeline integrates with Local Storage (can use remote cloud storage ) to store versioned data and artifacts, ensuring scalability.

Key Features:
DVC Integration: Tracks and versions datasets, models, and intermediate files without overloading the Git repository.
Cloud Storage: Local storage to simplify (otherwise use cloud) for storing large files securely and efficiently.
